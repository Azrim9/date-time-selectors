# Date Time Selectors with difference calculation

This project consists of an "App" Component which usesa "Date Time Selector" Component twice.

The App Component is using 2 instances of this component with props to differentiate which type of date selector you are creating (To or From).

Using different prop values:
The first one is a "from" date time selector
Second one is a "to" date time selector.

Once you select the "from" date and the "to" date, they are subtracted (to - from) to give you the difference in days!
